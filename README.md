# Candidate Elimination Algorithm

This Python script implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm to learn hypotheses based on the provided data. The algorithm refines the set of hypotheses by considering positive and negative target outcomes.

## Usage

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Place the "2ce.csv" file in the same directory as the script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.

4. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
Certainly! Here's an example of a `README.md` file that describes your Python script and its functionality:

## About the Script

The `script.py` script implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm on the "2ce.csv" dataset using the pandas library.

### Functions

1. `learn(concepts, target)`: Implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm to learn specific and general hypotheses based on concepts and target outcomes.

### Input

The script uses the "2ce.csv" dataset, which contains concept features and target outcomes.

### Output

The script outputs the final specific and general hypotheses after applying the Candidate Elimination algorithm.

## How the Algorithm Works

1. The script reads the "2ce.csv" dataset and separates concept features from the target.

2. The learning iterations begin. For each concept and corresponding target outcome:

   - If the target is "Yes," the script updates the specific hypothesis and general hypothesis.
   - If the target is "No," the script updates only the general hypothesis.

3. After learning iterations, the script identifies unchanged hypotheses in the general hypothesis and removes them.

4. The final specific and general hypotheses are returned.
